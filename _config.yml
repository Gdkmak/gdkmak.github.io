  A chronic learner, perseverant, trilingual data scientist with 5 years of experience in multiple fields such as data consulting, AdTech, 
  research and humanitarian. For the time being, my focus lies in building production-ready NLP applications. My practical expertise in
  applying a wide range of inferential and predictive models allowed me to foster publishers' 
  visitors-to-subscribers conversion rate, boost the user base for SaaS companies, and increase the time and effectiveness of aid delivery programmes.

  In this page I present some of my work using Machine Learning, NLP, inferential analysis with different frameworks,
  libraries and languages such as python, TensorFlow, sklear, Flask and others.
