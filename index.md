***Turkish Sentiment Analysis***
[<ins>GitHub<ins/>](https://github.com/Gdkmak/Turkish-Sentiment-Analysis/)

This project shows a comparison between three different approaches to train and test sentiment classification model to identify people’s opinions in Turkish language and label them as positive or negative, based on the emotions people’s express within them. Two Machine Learning techniques are namely Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Then Neural Networks using Embedding and 1D convolutional layers. Finally, the state-of-the-art pretrained BERT model is used to yield the best results. the following figures are yield from testing the models. 

Preprocessing|Naive Bayer|Logistic Rregression|Deep Learning|BERT
---|----|----|----|-----
No |87%|88%|88%|95% 
Yes|82%|82%|83%|88%

Technologies used: TensorFlow, Keras, sklearn, Transformer, Torch, Flask

- ***EDA Data Science Jobs***
[<ins>Google Colab<ins/>](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gdkmak/analytics/blob/master/EDA_Data_Science_Jobs.ipynb)
  
In this anlysis explore Data Science Jobs during pandamic, and try to explore some hidden detailes in mutiple industries and for different job describtions. The dataset was created by picklesueat and contains more than 3900 job listing for data scientist positions scraped from glassdoor and other sites.

- ***Hypothesis Testing And Predictive Analysis***
[<ins>GitHub<ins/>](https://github.com/Gdkmak/analytics/blob/master/Hypothesis_Testing_And_Predictive_Analysis.ipynb/)

The data is taken from lacity.org website. It has payroll information for all Los Angeles City Employees including the City's three proprietary departments: Water and Power, Airports and Harbor. Two types of hypothesis testing is applied to check if there is a difference in the payroll between two years 2015 and 2016. In addition, predictive analysis is implemented using Random Forest and Linear Regression.
